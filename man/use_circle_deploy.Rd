\item{repo}{The Circle CI project. By default the current directory name will
be used.}

\item{user}{The username for the repository. By default queried using `get_user()`.}
}
\description{
Checks and eventually creates a "user-key" to enable
  deployment from Circle CI builds.
}
\details{
The easiest way to achieve a deployment from Circle CI builds to a Github
repo is by creating a so called "user-key" with your Circle CI
account. Essentially, this is a SSH key pair.

This function checks for the presence of such and, if missing, creates one.

If the repo has not been enabled yet on Circle CI, please run `enable_repo()`
first. Also to be able to log in to Github, you will need to have a
`GITHUB_TOKEN` being set as an environment variable. If you are unsure
if you have done this already, call `usethis::github_token()`.
If none is set, this function will prompt you to create one.
