\title{Circle CI API Client}
\description{
This package provides functionality for interacting with the
Circle CI API. \href{https://circleci.com}{Circle CI} is a continuous
integration provider which allows for
automated testing of software each time that software is publicly committed
to a repository on GitHub.

This package interacts with the Circle CI REST API and allows to execute
tasks in R without visiting the the website. This includes monitoring
builds, modifying build environment settings and environment variables, and
cancelling or restarting builds.

Use of this package requires a Circle API key. Unless a key is already set,
users will be guided through the creation of a key,
API keys are disposable, but should still be treated securely.

Use \code{\link[=github_repo]{github_repo()}} to get the name of the current repository
as determined from the \code{origin} remote.
The following functions simplify integrating R package testing and deployment
with GitHub and Circle CI:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=circle_enable]{circle_enable()}} enables Circle CI for your repository,
\item \code{\link[=use_circle_deploy]{use_circle_deploy()}} installs a public deploy key on GitHub and the
corresponding private key on Circle CI to simplify deployments to GitHub
from Circle CI.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# check to see if you've authenticated correctly
get_circle_user()
}
