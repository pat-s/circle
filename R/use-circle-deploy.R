#' @title Set up deployment between Circle CI builds and Github repositories
#' @description Checks and eventually creates a "user-key" to enable
#'   deployment from Circle CI builds.
#' @param repo The Circle CI project. By default the current directory name will
#'   be used.
#' @template user
#'
#' @details
#' The easiest way to achieve a deployment from Circle CI builds to a Github
#' repo is by creating a so called "user-key" with your Circle CI
#' account. Essentially, this is a SSH key pair.
#'
#' This function checks for the presence of such and, if missing, creates one.
#'
#' If the repo has not been enabled yet on Circle CI, please run `enable_repo()`
#' first. Also to be able to log in to Github, you will need to have a
#' `GITHUB_TOKEN` being set as an environment variable. If you are unsure
#' if you have done this already, call `usethis::github_token()`.
#' If none is set, this function will prompt you to create one.
