# Authentication

To get started with Circle CI on Github, make sure to install the [Circle CI Github App](https://github.com/marketplace/circleci) and configure the "Free" plan for your account.

The first time any {circle} function is called, it will check for the existence of a Circle API key.
This API key is needed to securely talk to the Circle CI API and make requests.
There are two ways you can store the API key:

  - Via environment variable `R_CIRCLE` in `~/.Renviron` (**recommended**)
  - In `~/.circleci/cli.yml` via the following pattern

   ```yml
   host: https://circleci.com
   endpoint: graphql-unstable
   token: <token>
   ```

In addition, {circle} scrapes information about the current repository from Github.
To be able to do this, a `GITHUB_TOKEN` is needed.
You can create one using `usethis::browse_github_token()` if you haven't done so yet.

# Deployment

The easiest way to enable deployment from Circle CI builds to Github repositories is by using `use_circle_deploy()`:

```r
circle::use_circle_deploy()
✖ No 'user-key' found.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✔ Added a 'user key' to project '<repo-slug>' on Circle CI.
This enables deployment from builds.
```

This will generate an SSH key pair, store the public key in the Circle CI repo and the private key in your Github account under "Settings -> SSH and GPG keys".

To double-check, you now should have a "user-key" in your Circle CI repo settings under the menu point "Checkout keys".
It does not matter if another "deploy key" exists.
The important point is that the "user key" is set as "preferred".

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig.1: Screenshot showing an existing user key for repository 'ropenscilabs/circle'"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/user-key.png")
```

If you haven't set a "user-key" yet, there will be a button on this page "Add User Key" which will do exactly the same as `circle::use_circle_deploy()`.

## Deployment keys

There two different types of keys on Circle CI:

- Deploy key

- User key

"Deploy keys" are used to checkout your repository so that the build is starting.
These kind of keys how only "read" permissions but are not allow to "write" to your repository.
If you have connected Circle CI to Github already, you will have a "deploy key" stored in every repository to be able to checkout the code.
The name "deploy" key here is a bit misleading since they **cannot** be used for deploying from builds.

To enable deployment, a "user-key" is needed.
This key type also has "write" permissions and can be added using `use_circle_deploy()`.
`use_circle_deploy()` will add a so called "user key" to the settings of the repo on Circle CI.
The private key will be added to your Github profile under the "SSH and GPG keys" section with the title pointing to the respective repo.
See also [the Circle CI section about deployment](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/deployment-integrations/#section=deployment).

If you do not want to use `use_circle_deploy()` and go the manual way of adding a SSH key to Circle CI, please be aware of [this issue](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/adding-ssh-keys-fails/7747).
